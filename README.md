# proofreading

# What is this?
This repository contains my work proofreading classic works of Catholicism (particularly those written by St Francis de Sales).

# How can I help?
Please feel free to report errors using an *Issue* or collaborate using a *Pull request*.

# Methodology
As for methodology, I intend to follow the standard Distributed Proofreaders guidelines as much as I can, even though the chances of my work being transferred to Distributed Proofreaders is very small. Because I am likely to do much of the work on my own, I will only follow certain rules in so far as they are convenient to my own usage.

TL;DR. I do not fix spelling, capitalisation, or grammar inconsistencies, but may fix formatting and obvious printing errors.

# What will be end product be like?
I won't correct any apparent misspellings but will correct printing/formatting errors if they are very evident. No parts of the text will be changed to avoid rendering the Imprimatur void.

I intend to produce for every work the following files:

- workname_plaintext: This will contain the works in plaintext (without any markup).
- workname.md: This will contain the work formatted using markdown.
- workname.epub: This will contain the work formatted using markdown and converted to epub.

Please feel free to send me a copy of any reformatted/re-typeset so that I can add it here, but don't feel you have to.

# Licensing

All the work I perform is released into the public domain using the Unlicense. I make no copyright claims whatsoever on my work, or any work made by other people.
Scans produced by Google seem to be encumbered with a "non-commercial" clause that unfortunately I am not allowed to remove.
