      <p>
        The Spiritual Father who presents himself to you under this title is the
        gentle Bishop of Geneva, who, in the opinion of St. Jane Chantal and St.
        Vincent de Paul, was the most perfect imitation of our Saviour living
        among men.
      </p>
      <p>
        Love for souls is his great passion. He is not astonished at either
        falls or discouragement, which he cures by remedies as gentle as they
        are efficacious. Whatever your disposition you will find sometimes a
        word of consolation, sometimes a counsel of perfection, or a means of
        accomplishing a difficult step in the ways of God, and of elevating
        yourself to Him.
      </p>
      <p>
        This collection is like the inner life of the Saint unconsciously
        written by himself. He first practised, and then taught. One is gentle
        from motives of virtue, only when he possesses moral strength; now we
        find in these lines the secret of that strength which made St. Francis
        de Sales the gentlest of men. He admirably inculcates the method of
        sanctity which he perfectly possessed--a sanctity which seems so easy to
        realise that we feel a desire to reproduce it. It is the flower which
        the Spiritual Father causes to bloom in your soul. It will soon bear
        fruit if you are faithful.
      </p>

      <h2>MAXIMS AND COUNSELS</h2>
      <h3>OF</h3>
      <h2>St. Francis de Sales.</h2>
      <h4>FOR EVERY DAY OF THE</h4>
      <h4>YEAR.</h4>
      <hr />
    </div>
    <div class="bodymatter">
      <h3>1.</h3>
      <p>
        <span class="smallcaps">Keep</span> yourself faithfully in the presence
        of God; avoid hurry and anxiety, for there are no greater obstacles to
        our progress in perfection.
      </p>
      <h3>2.</h3>
      <p>
        Cast your heart gently, not violently, into the wounds of our Saviour;
        have an unlimited confidence in his mercy and goodness.
      </p>
      <h3>3.</h3>
      <p>
        To make good progress we must devote ourselves to getting over that
        portion of the path which lies close before us, and not amuse ourselves
        with the desire to attain the last step before we have accomplished the
        first.
      </p>
      <h3>4.</h3>
      <p>
        We must make our imperfections die with us from day to day. Dear
        imperfections, which cause us to recognise our misery, which exercise us
        in contempt of self, and the practice of virtue, and notwithstanding
        which God accepts the preparation of our hearts which is perfect.
      </p>
      <h3>5.</h3>
      <p>
        I recommend simplicity to you; look before you, and not at the dangers
        which you behold in the distance. Keep your will firmly bent upon
        serving God with your whole heart. While you are thus occupied in
        forecasting the future you expose yourself to some false step.
      </p>
      <h3>6.</h3>
      <p>
        Have no care for the morrow; think only of doing well to-day, and when
        to-morrow shall have become to-day then we shall think about it.
      </p>
      <h3>7.</h3>
      <p>
        We must make a provision of manna for each day only; and let us not be
        afraid that God will fail to send down more upon us to-morrow and the
        day after to-morrow, and every day of our pilgrimage.
      </p>
      <h3>8.</h3>
      <p>
        Since the Heart of our Lord has no more loving law than meekness,
        humility, and charity we must firmly maintain these dear virtues in us.
      </p>
      <h3>9.</h3>
      <p>
        True sanctity lies in love of God, and not in foolish imaginings,
        raptures, &c. Let us devote ourselves to the practice of true meekness
        and submission, to renouncement of self, to docility of heart, to love
        of abjection, to consideration for the wishes of others: this is true
        sanctity and the most amiable ecstasy of the children of God.
      </p>
      <h3>10.</h3>
      <p>
        May you belong to God for ever in this mortal life, serving Him
        faithfully through its trials, bearing the cross after Him, and may you
        be his for ever in life eternal with the whole celestial court!
      </p>
      <h3>11.</h3>
      <p>
        The great good of our souls is to live for God, and the greatest good to
        live for God alone.
      </p>
      <h3>12.</h3>
      <p>He who lives but for God is never sad, save at having offended God.</p>
      <h3>13.</h3>
      <p>
        He who lives but for God seeks only God, and since God is with him in
        adversity as well as in prosperity, he dwells in peace in the midst of
        tribulation.
      </p>
      <h3>14.</h3>
      <p>
        He who lives but for God frequently thinks of Him during all the
        occupations of life.
      </p>
      <h3>15.</h3>
      <p>
        Then let us belong wholly to Him, and live but for Him, desiring only to
        please Him, and for his creatures in Him, through Him, and for Him.
      </p>
      <h3>16.</h3>
      <p>
        Make your little efforts sweetly, peacefully, and amiably to please this
        Sovereign Goodness, and do not be astonished at difficulties.
      </p>
      <h3>17.</h3>
      <p>
        We must be constant in aspiring to the perfection of holy love, in order
        that love may be perfect; for the love which seeks anything less than
        perfection cannot fail to be imperfect.
      </p>
      <h3>18.</h3>
      <p>
        Never permit your soul to be sad and live in bitterness of spirit or
        scrupulous fear, since He who loved it and died to give it life is so
        good, so sweet, so amiable.
      </p>
      <h3>19.</h3>
      <p>
        To live contentedly in our exile, we must keep before our eyes the hope
        of our arrival in the country where we shall live for ever.
      </p>
      <h3>20.</h3>
      <p>
        God, who calls us to Him, sees how we are approaching, and will never
        permit anything to happen but what is for our greater good.
      </p>
      <h3>21.</h3>
      <p>
        God knows what we are, and will hold out his paternal hand to us in a
        difficult step, in order that nothing may arrest us.
      </p>
      <h3>22.</h3>
      <p>
        Never look forward to the accidents of life with apprehension;
        anticipate them with a perfect hope that God, whose child you are, will
        deliver you from them, according as they come.
      </p>
      <h3>23.</h3>
      <p>
        God has preserved you so far; only keep yourself faithful to the law of
        his providence and He will assist you at all times, and where you cannot
        walk He will carry you.
      </p>
      <h3>24.</h3>
      <p>
        Do not think of what may happen you to-morrow, for the same eternal
        Father who cares for you to-day will care for you to-morrow and always;
        either He will not send you trouble, or, if He does, He will give you
        invincible courage to bear it.
      </p>
      <h3>25.</h3>
      <p>
        The child can never perish who remains in the arms of a Father who is
        almighty.
      </p>
      <h3>26.</h3>
      <p>
        If God does not always give us what we ask, it is to keep us near Him
        and give us an opportunity to urge and constrain Him by a loving
        violence.
      </p>
      <h3>27.</h3>
      <p>
        Behold this great Artisan of mercy. He converts our miseries into graces
        and the poison of our iniquities into salutary remedies for our souls.
        Tell me, I pray, what will He not do with the afflictions, the labours,
        the persecutions which assail us?
      </p>
      <h3>28.</h3>
      <p>
        An over-sensitive mind can neither receive nor endure anything without
        telling of it, and it is always a little astonished at the lowly places
        which humility and simplicity choose.
      </p>
      <h3>29.</h3>
      <p>
        I see you with your vigorous heart which loves and wills powerfully. I
        like it, for what are those half-dead hearts good for? We must make a
        particular exercise once every week of willing to love the will of God
        more tenderly, more affectionately than anything in the world, and that,
        too, not only in bearable but in the most unbearable events.
      </p>
      <h3>30.</h3>
      <p>
        Even at a time when you had not so much confidence in God, did you
        perish in affliction? Then why have you not courage to meet all other
        trials?
      </p>
      <h3>31.</h3>
      <p>
        Plant in your heart Jesus Christ Crucified, and all the crosses of this
        world will seem to you like roses.
      </p>
      <h3>32.</h3>
      <p>
        We must not only be willing that God should strike us, but we must
        accept that He shall strike us where He wills.
      </p>
      <h3>33.</h3>
      <p>
        Lord Jesus, without reserve, without an if, without a but, without
        exception, without limitation, may thy holy will he done in all things,
        at all times.
      </p>
      <h3>34.</h3>
      <p>
        Daily strengthen yourself more and more in the resolution, which you
        formed with so much affection: of serving God according to his good
        pleasure.
      </p>
      <h3>35.</h3>
      <p>
        Never think you have attained the purity of heart which you owe to God
        until your will is freely and joyfully resigned to his holy will in all
        things, even in the most repugnant.
      </p>
      <h3>36.</h3>
      <p>
        Regard not the appearance of the things you are to do, but Him who
        commands them, and who, when He pleases, can accomplish his glory and
        our perfection through the most imperfect and trifling things.
      </p>
      <h3>37.</h3>
      <p>
        A true servant of God has no care for the morrow; he performs faithfully
        what is required of him to-day, and to-morrow he will do what is
        required of him without a word.
      </p>
      <h3>38.</h3>
      <p>
        So, no matter how God treats you, it is all the same to you, you tell
        me.... Ah! how suddenly self-love insinuates itself into our affections,
        however devout they may appear.
      </p>
      <h3>39.</h3>
      <p>
        Here is the great lesson: We must discover God's will, and, recognising
        it, we must endeavour to do it joyfully, or at least courageously.
      </p>
      <h3>40.</h3>
      <p>
        The meek Saviour would have us meek, so that, though surrounded by the
        world and the flesh, we may live by the Spirit; that, amidst the
        vanities of earth, we may live in heaven; that, living among men, we may
        praise Him with the angels.
      </p>
      <h3>41.</h3>
      <p>
        The sight alone of our dear Jesus crucified can speedily soften all
        sorrows, which are but flowers compared with his thorns. And then our
        great <em>rendezvous</em> is an eternal heaven; and compared with the
        price of eternity, what are the things which end with time?
      </p>
      <h3>42.</h3>
      <p>
        Continue to unite yourself more and more with our Lord. Plunge your
        heart into the charity of his, and say always with your whole soul: "May
        I die and may Jesus live!" Our death will he a happy one if we have died
        daily.
      </p>
      <h3>43.</h3>
      <p>
        The repugnance you feel testifies no want of love; for it seems to me
        that, if we believed that being flayed God would love us more we would
        flay ourselves, not without repugnance, but in spite of the repugnance.
      </p>
      <h3>44.</h3>
      <p>
        Cultivate not only a solid love, but a tender, gentle, meek love for
        those about you; I have learned from experience that infirmities
        destroy, not our charity, but our meekness towards our neighbour, if we
        are not strongly on our guard.
      </p>
      <h3>45.</h3>
      <p>
        Lord Jesus, what true happiness for a soul consecrated to God to be
        strongly exercised in tribulation before leaving this life!
      </p>
      <h3>46.</h3>
      <p>
        How can we know frank, ardent love but in the midst of thorns, crosses,
        weariness, above all, when this weariness is prolonged?
      </p>
      <h3>47.</h3>
      <p>
        Nothing can give us deeper peace in this world than to frequently
        contemplate our Lord in all the afflictions He endured from his birth to
        his death: contempt, calumnies, poverty, abjection, weariness,
        suffering, nakedness, wrongs, and grief of every kind.
      </p>
      <h3>48.</h3>
      <p>
        A heart which esteems and grandly loves Jesus crucified, loves his
        death, his sufferings, his insults, his poverty, his hunger, his thirst;
        and when Jesus grants this heart a small share in them, it is jubilant
        with gladness and lovingly embraces them.
      </p>
      <h3>49.</h3>
      <p>
        Every day, not in prayer, but in your walks, you should recall to mind
        our Lord amid the thorns of our redemption, and consider what happiness
        it would be to share them.
      </p>
      <h3>50.</h3>
      <p>
        Let us faithfully cultivate that resignation and pure love of God which
        is never wholly practised but amid sufferings; for to love God, when He
        feeds us with sweetness is nothing more than children do; but to love
        Him when He feeds us with gall is to offer Him the cup of our loving
        fidelity.
      </p>
      <h3>51.</h3>
      <p>
        I recommend you to God, that you may obtain the gift of holy patience;
        and it is not in my power to propose to Him anything for you, save that
        He may, according to his holy will, fashion your heart for his dwelling,
        and reign there eternally; and whether He fashion it with the brush, the
        hammer, or the chisel, must be according to his good pleasure.
      </p>
      <h3>52.</h3>
      <p>
        The heart which unites itself to the Heart of God cannot help loving and
        accepting with sweetness the arrows with which God pierces it.
      </p>
      <h3>53.</h3>
      <p>
        I desire that your cross and mine should be wholly the cross of Jesus
        Christ; and as to the imposition of this or that burden, or making any
        choice, God knows what He is doing and why He does it--it is certainly
        for our good.
      </p>
      <h3>54.</h3>
      <p>
        Our sweet Saviour is pleased that we should speak to Him of the trouble
        He sends us, and that we should complain, provided it be lovingly and
        humbly, and to Himself, just as little children do when their mother has
        punished them.
      </p>
      <h3>55.</h3>
      <p>
        God wishes that, like Job, I should serve Him in the midst of dryness,
        suffering, and temptation; like St. Paul, that I should serve Him
        according to his desire. You will see that one day He will do all and
        even more than you can desire.
      </p>
      <h3>56.</h3>
      <p>
        I praise God for the constancy with which you bear tribulations.
        Nevertheless I still see in you a little over-eagerness and restlessness
        which form an obstacle to the final effect of your patience.
      </p>
      <h3>57.</h3>
      <p>
        The effect of patience is to possess one's soul, and, in proportion to
        our patience do we acquire complete and perfect possession of our soul.
      </p>
      <h3>58.</h3>
      <p>
        We must lose everything rather than courage, confidence, and good-will.
      </p>
      <h3>59.</h3>
      <p>
        Would to God that we paid little attention to the condition of the road
        which alarms us, but kept our eyes steadily fixed upon Him who guides
        us, and the happy end to which He leads us.
      </p>
      <h3>60.</h3>
      <p>
        When you have meditated upon the grievous anguish which our Master
        endured in the Garden, and in union with Him prayed to the Father for
        consolation, if it does not please Him to send it, think no more of it,
        but brace your courage to work out your salvation on the cross, as if
        you were never to descend therefrom, and as if you were never to see the
        atmosphere of your life clear and serene.
      </p>
      <h3>61.</h3>
      <p>
        For the honour of God yield completely to his will, and do not think
        that you can serve Him better another way, for we serve Him well only
        when we serve Him as He wills.
      </p>
      <h3>62.</h3>
      <p>
        We are always wishing for this or that, and though we have our sweet
        Jesus in our breasts, we are not content. Yet it is all we can desire.
        One thing alone is necessary, and that is, to be near Him.
      </p>
      <h3>63.</h3>
      <p>
        Train yourself to serve our Lord with a strong and fervent gentleness:
        it is the true way of serving Him.
      </p>
      <h3>64.</h3>
      <p>
        Frequently kiss in your heart the crosses which our Lord Himself has
        placed in your arms. Heed not whether they are of perfumed or precious
        wood: they are more truly crosses when they are of coarse, heavy,
        ordinary wood.
      </p>
      <h3>65.</h3>
      <p>
        This sweet love of our hearts casts us down only to raise us up. He
        lurks and hides, peeping through the lattice, to see the expression of
        our countenance.
      </p>
      <h3>66.</h3>
      <p>
        Keep Jesus closely in your arms, for it is thus the Spouse holds Him as
        a bouquet of myrrh, that is of bitterness: but He is not bitter; He only
        allows us to be bitter to ourselves.
      </p>
      <h3>67.</h3>
      <p>
        Being a good servant of God is not always having consolation and
        sweetness, nor being always free from aversion and repugnance to good.
      </p>
      <h3>68.</h3>
      <p>
        To be a good servant of God is to be charitable to our neighbour,
        maintaining in the superior will an invincible resolution to do God's
        will: to possess great humility and simplicity in confiding one's self
        to God; to rise as frequently as one falls; to inure one's self to
        humiliations, and to tranquilly bear with others and their defects.
      </p>
      <h3>69.</h3>
      <p>
        Frequently behold our Lord who looks down upon you, poor little creature
        that you are, and sees you in the midst of your labours and
        distractions.
      </p>
      <h3>70.</h3>
      <p>
        Frequently raise your heart to God, ask his help, and let the foundation
        of your consolation be the happiness of belonging to Him.
      </p>
      <h3>71.</h3>
      <p>
        Let us raise up our hearts, and behold that of God all goodness, all
        love, all love for us! Let us adore and bless his will in all things,
        let Him prune, let Him cut where He will, for we are eternally his.
      </p>
      <h3>72.</h3>
      <p>
        Let us place ourselves before our Crucified Sun, as the weary bee basks
        in the rays of the sun, and then let us say to Him: "O beautiful Sun of
        hearts, Thou dost vivify all by the rays of thy goodness; behold us
        exhausted before thee, whence we will not move, Lord Jesus, until Thy
        fire hath revived us!"
      </p>
      <h3>73.</h3>
      <p>
        Let us not forget the maxim of the saints, which warns us that every day
        we must feel that we begin our perfection; and if we bear this well in
        mind we will not be astonished at the miseries we find in ourselves. The
        work is never done, it must be always recommenced; and recommenced with
        a good heart.
      </p>
      <h3>74.</h3>
      <p>
        What we are about to commence will be better than what we have done, and
        when we shall have accomplished that, we will recommence something else
        which shall be still better, and then something else, until we leave
        this world to begin another life, which will have no end, for nothing,
        nothing better can come to us.
      </p>
      <h3>75.</h3>
      <p>
        See, then, whether one should weep when he finds trouble in his soul,
        and whether he ought not courageously to push on ever further, since he
        must never pause, and whether he ought not to have the resolution to
        prune, since we must use the knife, even to the division of soul and
        mind.
      </p>
      <h3>76.</h3>
      <p>
        Why do you weep, O woman? No, you must no longer be a woman, you must
        have the heart of a man. But courage! take heart! we have our sweet
        Jesus with us.
      </p>
      <h3>77.</h3>
      <p>
        The love of God does not consist in consolations, otherwise our Lord
        would not have loved his Father when He was sorrowful unto death, and
        when He cried, "My God, my God, why hast Thou forsaken me?" This was the
        greatest act of love which it is possible to imagine.
      </p>
      <h3>78.</h3>
      <p>
        Our imperfections should not please us, but they should not take away
        our courage. God does not like our imperfections and venial sins, but He
        loves us in spite of them.
      </p>
      <h3>79.</h3>
      <p>
        Live joyfully; our Lord looks down upon you, and looks upon you with
        love, and with a tenderness proportioned to your foolishness.
      </p>
      <h3>80.</h3>
      <p>
        Turn your eyes from yourself, and direct them towards God with an humble
        courage to speak to Him of his ineffable goodness in loving our poor
        human nature, in spite of its infirmities.
      </p>
      <h3>81.</h3>
      <p>
        Our enemy is a great bawler; be in no way troubled about him, for he
        cannot hurt you; despise him, and pay no attention to him. He made as
        much noise and thundered as loudly about the saints; but behold! they
        are lodged in the place which the miserable creature lost.
      </p>
      <h3>82.</h3>
      <p>
        Fear not; you are walking upon the sea, amid the winds and the waves,
        but it is with Jesus. If fear seizes you, cry loudly, "Lord, save me!"
        He will stretch forth his hand to you; clasp it firmly and go joyfully
        on.
      </p>
      <h3>83.</h3>
      <p>
        Despise, I pray you, all those thoughts of vainglory. For they are
        really but flies which cannot harm but only annoy you. It is an
        incompatible thing to be in this world and not to feel the movements of
        the passions.
      </p>
      <h3>84.</h3>
      <p>Let yourself be governed by God; do not think so much of yourself.</p>
      <h3>85.</h3>
      <p>
        I expressly forbid you to be over-eager, as this is the mother
        imperfection of all imperfections.
      </p>
      <h3>86.</h3>
      <p>
        Simplify your judgment. "If your eye is simple, your whole body will be
        light." Do not make so many reflections and replies, but go on with
        simplicity and confidence.
      </p>
      <h3>87.</h3>
      <p>
        For you there are but God and yourself in the world, and you should not
        concern yourself for all the rest, save as God commands you.
      </p>
      <h3>88.</h3>
      <p>
        Give your soul a thousand times to God, and sometimes say not a word to
        Him, but simply contemplate his gentleness. This is one of the great
        sources of spiritual gain, for as the mind converses so frequently and
        so easily with its God it will be perfumed with all his perfections.
      </p>
      <h3>89.</h3>
      <p>
        The Christian soul is the spouse not yet of Jesus glorified, but of
        Jesus crucified; that is why the rings, ornaments, and tokens with which
        He adorns her are crosses, and thorns, and the nuptial banquet is gall,
        hyssop, and vinegar.
      </p>
      <h3>90.</h3>
      <p>
        Do not look here and there so much. Turn your eyes upon God or yourself;
        you will never see God without goodness, or yourself free from misery;
        and you will find his goodness kind to your misery, and your misery the
        object of his mercy.
      </p>
      <h3>91.</h3>
      <p>
        Rarely examine closely what others do; look upon them simply, kindly,
        and amiably. Do like the bees, gather honey from all the flowers.
      </p>
      <h3>92.</h3>
      <p>
        My commandment is, that you do like little children; while they feel
        their mother holding them by the sleeve, they go on boldly and run about
        everywhere, nothing daunted by the falls that are caused by the weakness
        of their legs. Thus, while God holds you by your good-will to serve Him,
        go on boldly, undaunted by your little stumblings, provided you cast
        yourself into his arms and give Him the kiss of charity.
      </p>
      <h3>93.</h3>
      <p>
        Go joyously and with a light heart as far as you can, and if you cannot
        always go joyously, go always courageously and confidently.
      </p>
      <h3>94.</h3>
      <p>
        We must have patience, and little by little, correct and overcome our
        bad habits, for life on the whole is a continual warfare.
      </p>
      <h3>95.</h3>
      <p>
        Rest is reserved for heaven; on earth we must always struggle between
        hope and fear, on condition that hope be ever the stronger when we
        consider the almighty power of Him who helps us.
      </p>
      <h3>96.</h3>
      <p>
        Frequently during the day cast your heart, your mind, and your care upon
        God with great confidence, saying, "I am thine, save me."
      </p>
      <h3>97.</h3>
      <p>
        Be kind to your neighbour in spite of rebellious murmurings and
        outbursts of anger.
      </p>
      <h3>98.</h3>
      <p>
        Do not be astonished to find yourself overwhelmed with evil
        inclinations. God permits them in order to make you humble.
      </p>
      <h3>99.</h3>
      <p>
        Self-love may be mortified in us, but it never dies; from time to time
        it sends forth shoots which prove that, though cut down to the root, it
        is never completely destroyed.
      </p>
      <h3>100.</h3>
      <p>
        Self-love never leaves us. It sleeps sometimes like a fox, then suddenly
        springs upon the chickens. We must therefore be constant watchful of it,
        and patiently defend ourselves against it.
      </p>
      <h3>101.</h3>
      <p>
        Let us keep firm hold of the merciful hand of our good God, for He
        wishes to draw us after Him.
      </p>
      <h3>102.</h3>
      <p>
        Live wholly according to the Spirit, live quietly in peace, have perfect
        confidence that God will help you.
      </p>
      <h3>103.</h3>
      <p>
        Be careful to purify your heart more and more each day. Now, this purity
        consists in weighing everything in the scales of the sanctuary, which
        are only the will of God.
      </p>
      <h3>104.</h3>
      <p>
        Let us be what we are, and be that well, in order that we may honour the
        Master Workman who has made us. Though we were the most excellent
        creatures under heaven, what would it avail us if we were not pleasing
        to the will of God?
      </p>
      <h3>105.</h3>
      <p>We must always and in all things live peaceably.</p>
      <h3>106.</h3>
      <p>
        I approve of your making an act of humility every day, humbling yourself
        to an inferior, performing some menial office in the house.
      </p>
      <h3>107.</h3>
      <p>
        It is not possible that you should so soon be mistress of your soul, or
        that you should control it so absolutely at first.
      </p>
      <h3>108.</h3>
      <p>
        Dispose your soul to tranquillity in the morning, and be careful during
        the day to recall it frequently to that state, and to keep your soul
        within your control.
      </p>
      <h3>109.</h3>
      <p>
        Do not be terrified if you are guilty of some little impatience; do not
        let it trouble you, but when you recognise it quietly humble yourself
        before God.
      </p>
      <h3>110.</h3>
      <p>
        Try to preserve a sweet tranquillity of mind; say to your soul:
        "Courage! we have made a false step, but let us keep steadily on and
        keep watch over ourselves."
      </p>
      <h3>111.</h3>
      <p>Make no account of the judgments of men.</p>
      <h3>112.</h3>
      <p>
        Be silent concerning all things, and you will have interior peace,
        because for you and me the only secret of acquiring this peace is to
        endure to the utmost the judgments of men.
      </p>
      <h3>113.</h3>
      <p>
        Consider for whom you labour, and those who strive to trouble you shall
        labour in vain.
      </p>
      <h3>114.</h3>
      <p>
        Among beggars, those whose sores are the most terrible consider
        themselves the most fortunate, for they excite more compassion and
        receive more abundant alms. We are only beggars, and the most miserable
        among us are the most fortunate, for these God looks upon with greater
        compassion.
      </p>
      <h3>115.</h3>
      <p>Be glad that men make no account of you.</p>
      <h3>116.</h3>
      <p>
        Consider how all the vexations of the past have vanished; those of the
        future shall vanish in the same way.
      </p>
      <h3>117.</h3>
      <p>
        The great point of humility is to see, to honour, to serve, and converse
        fittingly with those whom we dislike, keeping ourselves humble, gentle,
        and submissive to them, for remember that the humiliations which are the
        least visible are the keenest.
      </p>
      <h3>118.</h3>
      <p>
        Let our Lord turn us to the left or to the right, and send us in a
        hundred directions. He never abandons us but to get closer possession of
        us; He never leaves us but to guard us better; He never struggles with
        us but to enter our souls and bless us.
      </p>
      <h3>119.</h3>
      <p>
        Courage! Let us keep on in the low valleys of the small and humble
        virtues. I love these three little virtues: gentleness of heart,
        firmness of mind, and simplicity of life.
      </p>
      <h3>120.</h3>
      <p>
        I recommend to you more than anything else the exercise of holy
        gentleness and sweetness in all the events of this life.
      </p>
      <h3>121.</h3>
      <p>
        Accustom yourself in all that you do to act and speak gently and
        quietly, and you will see that in three or four years you will
        completely control that abrupt impulsiveness.
      </p>
      <h3>122.</h3>
      <p>
        He who can preserve peace in the midst of the confusion and complexity
        of business, and sweetness in the midst of suffering, is almost perfect.
      </p>
      <h3>123.</h3>
      <p>
        I recommend to you great evenness of temper, sweetness and gentleness of
        heart; for these virtues, like the oil of a lamp, maintain the flame of
        good example; for there is nothing more edifying to our neighbour than
        charitable kindliness.
      </p>
      <h3>124.</h3>
      <p>
        When shall we be wholly imbued with sweetness and gentleness towards our
        neighbour? You needed only that; your zeal was good, but it had this
        fault; it was a little bitter, over-urgent, and captious.
      </p>
      <h3>125.</h3>
      <p>
        Raise your eyes to heaven, and among the mortals now immortal there you
        will not find one who attained eternal happiness but through continual
        afflictions and trouble.
      </p>
      <h3>126.</h3>
      <p>
        Let us humble ourselves profoundly, and acknowledge that if God be not
        our shield and armour, we shall be pierced through and through with
        every kind of sin.
      </p>
      <h3>127.</h3>
      <p>
        I desire that you should be extremely lowly and humble in your own eyes,
        condescending and gentle as a dove.
      </p>
      <h3>128.</h3>
      <p>
        Do not be quick to speak; say much by a modest and judicious silence.
      </p>
      <h3>129.</h3>
      <p>
        Behold God in all things without exception, acquiescing in all his
        commands with great simplicity.
      </p>
      <h3>130.</h3>
      <p>
        Say frequently, in the midst of your contradictions and sufferings: This
        is the path to heaven; I behold the gate, and I am sure that the storms
        will not prevent my reaching it.
      </p>
      <h3>131.</h3>
      <p>
        Take no trouble on account of what the world thinks of you; despise its
        good opinion and its contempt, and let it say what it will of good or
        evil.
      </p>
      <h3>132.</h3>
      <p>
        Do not think that our Lord is further from you in the midst of
        turmoil.... It is not tranquillity which brings Him to our hearts, but
        the fidelity of our love.
      </p>
      <h3>133.</h3>
      <p>
        From day to day withdraw your heart from all lands of amusement and
        vanity, ... from all that turns you from a blessed eternity.
      </p>
      <h3>134.</h3>
      <p>
        I desire to love God or die; death or love, for life without love is
        worse than death.
      </p>
      <h3>135.</h3>
      <p>
        O God! it is towards Thee that I am sailing.... We reach the port
        through all storms, provided we have an upright heart, a good intention,
        firm courage, our eyes fixed upon God, and all our confidence in Him.
      </p>
      <h3>136.</h3>
      <p>
        Do not be vexed at the annoyances which come from the complexity of
        business; believe me, true virtue is not nourished in exterior repose
        any more than good fish in stagnant water.
      </p>
      <h3>137.</h3>
      <p>
        Keep your hearts well under control, beware of over-anxiety. Place your
        confidence in the providence of our Lord. Be fully convinced that heaven
        and earth shall pass away rather than that our Lord shall fail to
        protect you while you are his obedient daughter, or, at least, desirous
        to obey Him.
      </p>
      <h3>138.</h3>
      <p>
        Live wholly in our Lord, let Him be the atmosphere in which your heart
        breathes at ease.
      </p>
      <h3>139.</h3>
      <p>
        Give particular attention to the practice of gentleness, study every
        pulsation of your heart, and if it be not gentle, make it so before all
        things.

        I desire that upon all occasions during the day you should interiorly
        recollect yourself in God, addressing Him a few words of fidelity and
        love.
      </p>
      <h3>141.</h3>
      <p>
        Believe me, God loves souls shaken by storms, provided they receive all
        from his hands and valiantly strive to remain faithful in the midst of
        combats.
      </p>
      <h3>142.</h3>
      <p>
        One of the best penances and satisfactions which a heart guilty of some
        fault can offer is to endure a continual cross and abnegation of its
        self-love.
      </p>
      <h3>143.</h3>
      <p>
        It gives me an incomparable pleasure to think of the great honour it is
        for a soul to speak heart to heart with its God--that great, sovereign
        infinite Being--yes, for what the heart says to God is known only to God
        Himself. Is not this a marvellous secret!
      </p>
      <h3>144.</h3>
      <p>
        When we pray it is well to think that there is no one in the world but
        God.
      </p>
      <h3>145.</h3>
      <p>
        The great secret in prayer is simply to follow the attractions of the
        heart. We must go on in good faith and with pure intention to reach God,
        to love Him, and unite ourselves to Him. True love has little method.
      </p>
      <h3>146.</h3>
      <p>
        You should be so in love with God that even though you can do nothing in
        his presence, you should nevertheless be glad to be near Him, were it
        only to see Him and look at Him from time to time.
      </p>
      <h3>147.</h3>
      <p>
        When your heart is distracted in prayer, bring it gently back to the
        point from which it has wandered, and lay it tenderly at the feet of its
        Master. If you do but this your hour will be well employed.
      </p>
      <h3>148.</h3>
      <p>
        If we can speak to our Lord in prayer let us speak to Him, praise Him,
        listen to Him. If we cannot speak because we are spiritually hoarse, let
        us stay nevertheless and make Him a reverence.
      </p>
      <h3>149.</h3>

        What a happiness it is to be with God, no one knowing what passes
        between God and the heart but God Himself and the adoring heart.

        I should like to have a good hammer with which to blunt the sharpness of
        your mind, which is too subtle in its ideas of your advancement. I have
        often told you that in devotion we must go on in good faith, acting
        frankly and promptly. If you do well, praise God; if ill, humble
        yourself.
      </p>
      <h3>151.</h3>
      <p>
        Humble yourself profoundly, and urge on your soul with the love of
        Christ crucified, that you may be able to spiritually digest this
        heavenly food.

        He who communicates according to the spirit of the Spouse annihilates
        himself before God, saying to our Lord: Destroy me, annihilate me, and
        convert me into Thee; then it is no longer we who live, but Jesus
        Christ, who liveth in us.

        When the mother pearl has received the drops of the fresh morning dew it
        draws within itself and closes its shell to preserve them fresh; in like
        manner, when you have received the Blessed Sacrament, withdraw into
        yourself and collect all the faculties of your soul to adore this
        sovereign King, and relish by a lively faith the spiritual refreshment
        which this Divine Germ produces in your breast.

        Take your rest as much as possible near the heavenly Infant. See how He
        receives the breath of that great ox and that ass, which neither feel
        his presence nor show it by any movement. Will He not then receive the
        inspirations of our poor hearts?

        How happy we should be had we only Jesus in our understanding, only
        Jesus in our imagination! Jesus would be in us everywhere, and we
        everywhere in Jesus.

      <h3>156.</h3>
      <p>
        We should manage our years, our months, our weeks, our days, our hours,
        our moments so well that, being employed for the love of God, they all
        may be profitable to us for eternal life.
      </p>

        Shall we not, in future, cease to be the old selves, which shall all,
        without exception, be for ever sacrificed unreservedly and
        unconditionally to God and his love?

        When you encounter things which give you trouble, remember that the

        A person who is free from the fever of her own will is satisfied with
        everything, provided God be served. She is indifferent to the nature of
        the service which God chooses to give her.
      </p>
      <h3>160.</h3>
      <p>
        Frequently say to our Lord: What wilt Thou that I do? Is it Thy will
        that I should serve Thee in the most lowly duties of the house? Provided
        I serve Thee, I care not what the service may be.
      </p>
      <h3>161.</h3>
      <p>
        Love this good God in your retreats, in Holy Communion, and when He
        consoles you; love Him particularly in the midst of trouble and
        confusion, in aridity, contradictions, and tribulations; for it was thus
        He loved you in the midst of the scourging, the nails, the thorns, the
        darkness of Calvary.
      </p>
      <h3>162.</h3>

        The monastery is a hospital of spiritual sick who desire to be cured,
        and to this end submit themselves to the knife, to the lancet, to be
        burned, to be bled, and to all kinds of bitter remedies. O my very dear
        daughter, firmly resolve that you will submit to all this, and pay no
        attention to what self-love may urge to the contrary, but sweetly,
        amiably, and lovingly take the blessed resolution: to die or to be
        cured.
      </p>
      <h3>163.</h3>
      <p>
        Must you be disquieted and troubled because of difficulties? Oh, by no
        means. It is the devil who is ferreting and spying about your mind, to
        see if he cannot find some door open to him.
      </p>
      <h3>164.</h3>
      <p>
        You are right not to care what is said of you; you who belong to God
        should not think of reputation. Let God dispose of our life, our
        reputation, and our honour as He pleases, since they are all his. If our
        humiliations be his glory, are we not glorified?
      </p>
      <h3>165.</h3>
      <p>
        When you meet with contradictions or afflictions through anyone, beware
        of yielding to complaints, but compel your heart to suffer tranquilly;
        if some sudden outburst of impatience escape you, bring your heart back
        to sweetness and peace.
      </p>
      <h3>166.</h3>
      <p>
        See, my daughter, we are too fastidious in calling poor a state in which
        we endure neither hunger, nor cold, nor ignominy, but merely some
        inconvenience in our plans.
      </p>
      <h3>167.</h3>
      <p>
        Gradually temper the vivacity of your mind to patience, sweetness,
        humility, and affability, in the midst of the silliness and
        imperfections of your sisters.
      </p>
      <h3>168.</h3>
      <p>
        Nothing gives us profound tranquillity in this world but to frequently
        look upon our Lord in all his sufferings. In comparison with all that He
        endured, we shall see that we are wrong to call the little accidents
        which we encounter afflictions, and that we do not need patience for
        things so trifling, since a little modesty would suffice to make us bear
        well all that happens to us.
      </p>
      <h3>169.</h3>
      <p>
        We must never answer temptations, nor appear to hear the enemy. If he is
        noisy, patience! we must prostrate ourselves before God and remain at
        his feet. He will understand that we want his assistance, though we may
        not be able to speak.
      </p>
      <h3>170.</h3>
      <p>
        Believe me, my dear daughter, sweets engender worms in little children;
        that is why our Lord mixes bitter with the sweet for us. We must have a
        great courage, which on all occasions will resolutely cry, God be
        praised! caring little for sweet or bitter, light or darkness. Let us
        keep on in this essential love.
      </p>
      <h3>171.</h3>
      <p>
        God desires that you serve Him without relish or feeling, in the midst
        of aversions and afflictions of mind. This service will not give you
        satisfaction, but it will content Him; it will not be to your taste but
        it will be to his.
      </p>
      <h3>172.</h3>
      <p>
        God is so good that He will visit your soul interiorly, and strengthen
        and establish it in solid humility, simplicity, and mortification.
      </p>
      <h3>173.</h3>
      <p>
        Let us always keep on; however slow our progress we are getting over a
        great deal of the road. God wishes that our misery should be the throne
        of his mercy.
      </p>
      <h3>174.</h3>
      <p>
        Keep your heart brave and ready for any service that shall be imposed
        upon it; according as you undertake many things for God, He will second
        you and work with you.
      </p>
      <h3>175.</h3>
      <p>
        Have the heart of a child; a will of wax, and a mind free from the
        slavery of all affection.
      </p>
      <h3>176.</h3>
      <p>
        Oh, what a great blessing it is, my daughter, to be pliable and easily
        turned to any service. Our Lord has taught us this submission by his
        example, as much as by his words.
      </p>
      <h3>177.</h3>
      <p>
        He who is very attentive to please the heavenly lover has no leisure for
        introspection; his mind continually tends whither love leads him.
      </p>
      <h3>178.</h3>
      <p>
        This exercise of the continual abandonment of one's self to the hands of
        God includes in the most excellent manner all other exercises in their
        greatest simplicity, purity, and perfection, and while God leaves us the
        desire for it we should not change it.
      </p>
      <h3>179.</h3>
      <p>
        Simplicity is an act of charity pure and simple, which considers only
        God. It looks straight at God, and can suffer no mixture of
        self-interest nor intermingling of creatures; God alone is its object.
      </p>
      <h3>180.</h3>
      <p>
        We should bear tenderly with those whom our Lord bears with, we must bow
        our heads, and bear ourselves contrary to our habits and inclinations.
      </p>
      <h3>181.</h3>
      <p>
        Complain as little as possible of injuries, for it rarely happens that
        one complains without sin, since our self-love exaggerates in our eyes
        and hearts the wrongs we have received.
      </p>
      <h3>182.</h3>
      <p>
        Hold the cross of our Lord upon your breast, and as long as you firmly
        clasp it in your arms, the enemy will be at your feet.
      </p>
      <h3>183.</h3>
      <p>
        Great evenness of temper, continual gentleness and suavity of heart, are
        more rare than perfect chastity, yet very desirable.
      </p>
      <h3>184.</h3>
      <p>
        As regards our perfection, which consists in the union of our soul with
        the Divine Goodness, it is only a question of knowing little and doing
        much.
      </p>
      <h3>185.</h3>
      <p>
        We must make up our minds to two things: one is, that we shall find bad
        weeds growing in our garden, and the other, that we will have the
        courage to uproot them, for our self-love will live as long as we do,
        and from it arises all this noxious growth.
      </p>
      <h3>186.</h3>
      <p>
        We must endeavour to double, not our desires and our exercises, but the
        perfection with which we fulfil them, seeking by this means to gain more
        by one action than we would by a hundred others done according to our
        inclination and affection.
      </p>
      <h3>187.</h3>
      <p>
        One act performed in dryness of spirit is worth more than several done
        in great sensible fervour.
      </p>
      <h3>188.</h3>
      <p>
        I say, then, that we must die in order that God may live in us, for it
        is impossible to acquire union with God by any other means than
        mortification. These words, "We must die," are hard, but they are
        followed by a great sweetness, and this sweetness is union with God.
      </p>
      <h3>189.</h3>
      <p>
        Your miseries and infirmities should not astonish you; God has seen many
        others, and his mercy does not reject the miserable, but is exercised in
        doing them good.
      </p>
      <h3>190.</h3>
      <p>
        We must do everything through a motive of love, and nothing through
        compulsion. Our love for obedience must be greater than our fear of
        disobedience.
      </p>
      <h3>191.</h3>
      <p>
        I leave you liberty of spirit, not that which excludes obedience, but
        that which excludes constraint, scruple, or over-eagerness.
      </p>
      <h3>192.</h3>
      <p>
        Here are the marks of true liberty: 1^{st}. The heart which possesses
        this liberty is not attached to consolations, but receives afflictions
        with all the sweetness that the flesh admits of. I do not say that it
        does not love and desire consolations, but that the heart is not bound
        to them.
      </p>
      <h3>193.</h3>
      <p>
        2^{nd}. Such a heart is in no way attached to spiritual exercises, so
        that if sickness or any other accident interferes with them it feels no
        regret. I also do not say that it does not love them, but that it is not
        attached to them.
      </p>
      <h3>194.</h3>
      <p>
        3^{rd}. Such a heart rarely loses its joy, for no privation saddens one
        whose heart is not bound to anything. I do not say that it
        <em>never</em> loses its joy, but that it is only for a short time.
      </p>
      <h3>195.</h3>
      <p>
        A soul which possesses true liberty will leave his prayer, and with an
        amiable countenance and gracious manner greet the importunate person who
        disturbs him. For it is the same to him whether he serve God in
        meditation or by bearing with his neighbour; they are both the will of
        God.
      </p>
      <h3>196.</h3>
      <p>
        Liberty of spirit has two vices: a spirit of inconstancy and a spirit of
        constraint. For example: I resolve to make a meditation every morning.
        If I have a spirit of inconstancy I will defer it till evening at the
        slightest excuse--for the barking of a dog which has disturbed my sleep,
        for a letter to be written, though it is not at all urgent. On the
        contrary, if I have a spirit of constraint I will not omit my
        meditation, even though a sick person is very much in need of my
        services.
      </p>
      <h3>197.</h3>
      <p>
        Everything tends to the good of those who love God. And, in truth, since
        God can draw good from evil, for whom will He do it, if not for those
        who have given themselves without reserve to Him? Yes, everything tends
        to their profit, even sin. David would never have been so humble if he
        had not sinned; nor would Magdalene's love for her Saviour have been
        what it was. Tell me, then, what will He not do with our afflictions and
        labours?
      </p>
      <h3>198.</h3>
      <p>
        If, then, it ever happen that some grief come upon you, assure your soul
        that if she love God all things will turn to her good. And though you
        may not see the means by which this good shall be effected, be all the
        more convinced of it.
      </p>
      <h3>199.</h3>
      <p>
        It is a very good sign that the enemy rages and beats at your door: it
        shows that he has not what he wants. If he had he would cease to cry
        out, but would quietly enter and stay with you.
      </p>
      <h3>200.</h3>
      <p>
        Courage! As long as we can say, even coldly, God be praised, there is no
        reason to fear. And do not tell me that it seems to you that you say it
        in a spiritless way, with no strength or courage, but as if you had to
        do violence to yourself to utter it. Oh, this is the blessed violence
        which taketh heaven!
      </p>
      <h3>201.</h3>
      <p>
        As long as a temptation is displeasing to you there is nothing to fear,
        for why does it displease you if not because you do not wish it?
      </p>
      <h3>202.</h3>
      <p>
        Moreover, these very importunate temptations come from the malice of the
        devil, but the trouble and suffering they cause us come from the mercy
        of God. He draws from the malice of his enemy the holy tribulation by
        which He refines the gold He desires to place in his treasury. Despise
        the temptations and embrace the tribulations.
      </p>
      <h3>203.</h3>
      <p>
        We must endure our own want of perfection, if we would attain
        perfection. I say that we must endure it patiently, but we must not love
        or caress it. It is by the endurance of this suffering that humility is
        nourished.
      </p>
      <h3>204.</h3>
      <p>
        Those who aspire to pure love of God have not so much need of patience
        with others as with themselves.
      </p>
      <h3>205.</h3>
      <p>
        We must confess the truth: we are poor creatures, capable of very little
        that is good; but God, who is infinitely good, is content with our poor
        labours, and finds acceptable the preparation of our heart.
      </p>
      <h3>206.</h3>
      <p>
        But what means this preparation of our heart according to the expression
        of Holy Writ: "God is greater than our heart, and our heart is greater
        than the world?" When our heart, in the solitude of meditation, prepares
        the service which it must render God, it effects marvels. All this
        preparation, nevertheless, is in no way proportioned to the grandeur of
        God, and ordinarily it exceeds our strength, and becomes too great to be
        carried out in our exterior actions.
      </p>
      <h3>207.</h3>
      <p>
        Our minds prepare for God a mortified flesh free from the rebellion of
        the senses, prayer free from distraction, a loving heart free from all
        bitterness, a humility free from all taint of vanity. All this is very
        good, an excellent preparation; but who carries it out? Alas! when we
        come to the practise of it, we fall short. Must we on this account be
        disquieted, troubled, or afflicted? No, certainly not. Must we apply
        ourselves to exciting a multitude of desires to stimulate ourselves to
        attain this perfection? By no means.
      </p>
      <h3>208.</h3>
      <p>
        I do not say that we must not tend to perfection; but we must not desire
        to attain it in a day, that is in a day of this mortal life, for such a
        desire would only uselessly disquiet us.
      </p>
      <h3>209.</h3>
      <p>
        It is not possible, I assure you, to be completely rid of self while we
        are on earth. We must always carry self with us, until God carries us to
        heaven; and while we carry self, we carry a burden of very little value.
      </p>
      <h3>210.</h3>
      <p>
        Solomon tells us that a servant who suddenly becomes mistress is a very
        insolent creature. Were a soul to become all at once perfect mistress of
        passions which it had long served, I fear it could not but be vain and
        proud.

        If in our heart there be a single thread of affection which is not for

        I cannot understand how you, a daughter of God, long since abandoned to
        the bosom of his mercy and consecrated to his love, can yield to such
        immoderate sadness. You should console yourself, despising all the
        mournful and melancholy suggestions with which the devil tries to weary
        you.

      <h3>213.</h3>

        Do not examine yourself so carefull to discover whether you are in
        perfection or not; for, should we attain the greatest perfection we
        should neither know nor recognise it, but always consider ourselves
        imperfect. The end of our examen should never be to discover whether we
        are imperfect, for that we should never doubt.
      </p>
      <h3>214.</h3>
      <p>
        Therefore we should never be astonished at imperfection or let it sadden
        us; for we cannot fail to find ourselves imperfect in this life, and
        there is no remedy for it save humility, since by this virtue we shall
        repair our faults and gradually improve.
      </p>
      <h3>215.</h3>
      <p>
        It is for the exercise of this virtue that our imperfections are left to
        us, since it is inexcusable not to seek to correct them, and excusable
        not to succeed perfectly; for it is not with imperfections as it is with
        sins.

        If you wish to do well, regard as a temptation every suggestion

        lies before it.

        We must not desire all to begin by perfection. It matters little how one

        I tell you that you will be faithful if you are humble. But will you be

        more so.

        You desire that it should always be spring in your soul, but that cannot
        be. We must endure vicissitudes of weather interiorly as well as
        exteriorly. It is only in heaven that we shall find the perpetual beauty
        of spring, the perpetual ripening of summer, the perpetual fruition of
        autumn. There we shall have no winter; but here winter is required for
        the exercise of abnegation, and a thousand little virtues which are
        practised in times of sterility.

        My God! We shall soon be in eternity, and then we shall see how

        now as if they were affairs of great importance.

        I am sad and will not speak; this is what parrots do. I am sad, but I

        Examine whether your heart pleases God?--you must not do it;-- but
        whether his pleases you? yes, truly, for if you look at his Heart, it
        cannot but please you, it is so sweet, so condescending, so loving
        towards frail creatures when they recognise their misery, so merciful to
        the miserable, so kind to the penitent....

        Be just; neither excuse nor accuse your poor soul without due

        pusillanimous.

        How many courtiers there are who go into the presence of the king a
        hundred times, not to speak to him or listen to him, but merely to be
        seen by him, and to show by this assiduity that they are his servants.
        When, then, you come into the presence of our Lord, speak to Him if you
        can; if you cannot, remain and show yourself to Him, and do not be
        anxious to do any more.

        You do nothing in meditation, you tell me. But what should you do if not
        just what you are doing, that is, presenting and representing your
        misery and nothingness to God? The most efficacious appeal a beggar can
        make is to expose to our eyes his ulcers and necessities.
      </p>
      <h3>227.</h3>
      <p>
        But sometimes you do not even do this, and you remain before Him like a
        phantom or statue. Well, that is something. In the palaces of princes
        and kings there are statues which are only meant to gratify the eyes of
        the king; content yourself with a similar service in the presence of
        God. He will animate the statue when it pleases Him. Were we to ask the
        statue if it desired anything it would answer, "No; I am where my master
        placed me, and his pleasure is the sole happiness of my being."

        Ah! but it is a good prayer, and a good method of keeping one's self in

      <h3>229.</h3>
      <p>
        As for me, I think that we keep ourselves in the presence of God even
        while we sleep, for we go to sleep in his presence and by his will. And
        when we wake we find that He is beside us, that He has not stirred from
        us, nor we from Him; therefore we have kept ourselves in his presence,
        though with closed eyes.

        Finally, do not be angry, or at least troubled because you have been

        overcome; do not be disquieted because you have allowed yourself to be
        disquieted by angry passions; but take your heart and place it gently in
        the hands of our Lord and ask Him to cure it; meanwhile, do all you can

        The highest degree of humility is not only to recognise but to love our
        abjection. I am guilty of a blunder; it brings humiliation upon me;
        good. I am guilty of immoderate anger; I am sorry for the offence
        against God, and very glad that it proves me vile, abject, and
        miserable.

        Do not be troubled about not making acts of virtue well; for, as I told
        you, they do not cease to be very good, even when made languidly and
        wearily as if by force. You can only give God what you have, and in this
        season of affliction you have no other action to offer Him.

        You will be very happy if you receive with a filial and loving heart

        I will not tell you not to regard your afflictions, for your impulsive
        heart will answer, "I cannot but consider them, they make themselves so
        keenly felt;" but I tell you to look at them through the cross, and you
        will find them so small, or at least so agreeable, that you will rather
        endure their suffering than all consolations without them.

        Ah! do not examine whether what you do is much or little, whether it is
        done well or ill, provided it be not sin, and provided you have an
        upright intention to do it for God. Do everything as perfectly as you
        can; but, once an action is performed, think no more of it, but rather
        of what there is to be done.

        We should equally resolve upon two things: first, to bring the utmost
        fidelity to the fulfilment of our exercises; second, to be in no way
        troubled, disquieted, or astonished if we sometimes fail; for the first
        comes from our fidelity, which should always be earnest and constantly
        increasing,[check] and the latter comes from our infirmity.

        We must, then, correct our poor heart gently and quietly, and not add to

        should say, "in the name of God, take courage; let us keep on and be
        more watchful in future; let us turn to our Helper and our God." Alas!
        we must be charitable to our poor soul, and refrain from severity as
        long as we see that its offences are not deliberate.

        The best thoughts, affections, and aspirations of a great soul are fixed

        There are two kinds of wills: one says, "I would like very much to do
        good; but it costs a disagreeable effort; it is too difficult;" the
        other says: "I desire indeed to do good; the will is not wanting, but
        the power alone stops me." The first fills hell, the second paradise,

        their hands, in their tongue, in their ears, in their feet. But what
        does this Saviour do in all these parts? He redresses, purifies, prunes,
        and vivifies all; the heart loves through Him,[check] the mind
        understands through Him, the breast breathes through Him, the eyes see

        To pray is to raise the mind to God and converse with Him concerning our
        interests with a reverent familiarity, and a confidence greater than has
        the most petted child in its mother, and to talk with Him of all things
        both high and low, of the things of heaven and the things of earth; it
        is to open one's heart to Him and pour it out unreservedly to Him; it is
        to tell Him of our labours, our sins, our desires, and all that is in
        our soul, and to find our rest with Him as we would with a friend. It is
        what the Holy Scripture calls "pouring forth one's heart as water before
        Him."

        All should serve charity and charity should serve no one, not even her
        Beloved, of whom she is not the servant, but the spouse, and to whom she
        owes love, not service.

      <h3>279.</h3>
      <p>
        Be patient with your trials; our Lord, alas! permits them that you may
        one day know what you are when left to yourself. Do you not see that the
        trouble of the day is lighter after the rest of the night? an evident
        sign that our soul needs but to firmly resign itself to its God, and to
        become indifferent to serving Him amid thorns or roses.

        Be a little lamb, a little dove, quite simple, sweet, and amiable,
        unquestioning and frank. Love this good God who loves you so much.

      <h3>281.</h3>
      <p>
        Be not too tender towards yourself; avoid weeping and complaints;
        endeavour to be free and detached from yourself, in order to be wholly
        under the guidance of God's hand, for where his spirit is there is also
        liberty.

        I see your childish tears and troubles. Know, then, that all our
        childishness comes from this: that we forget the maxims of the saints,
        who warn us that we must act as if we were daily to begin anew the
        labour of our advancement; we shall not be so much astonished to find
        miseries and faults to correct in ourselves. The work we have undertaken
        is never finished; we must continually begin over again with a good
        heart.
      </p>
      <h3>283.</h3>
      <p>
        There is and can be nothing which I cannot do, inasmuch as I place all
        my confidence in God, who can do all things, and with this confidence
        the soul courageously undertakes all that it is commanded, however
        difficult it may be.
      </p>

        Live joyously, my dearest daughters, in the midst of your holy
        occupations. When the atmosphere is heavy in the midst of aridity,
        labour independently of your heart by the practice of a holy abjection
        and humility.
      </p>
      <h3>285.</h3>
      <p>
        We shall never possess perfect sweetness and complete charity, if they
        be not exercised in spite of repugnance, aversion, and disgust. True
        peace does not consist in not combating but in conquering.
      </p>
      <h3>286.</h3>
      <p>
        It should be a source of humiliation to us that we are so little master
        of ourselves, and so fond of our ease. Our Saviour did not come to seek
        his ease or comfort, either spiritual or temporal, but to deny, to
        combat Himself, and to die.
      </p>
      <h3>287.</h3>
      <p>
        Do not allow yourself to yield in any way to sadness, which is the enemy
        to devotion. What, then, should sadden a soul which serves Him who shall
        be our joy forever?
      </p>
      <h3>288.</h3>
      <p>
        Our Lord revealed to Blessed Angela that there is no good so pleasing to
        Him as that which is done by force; that is, the good which a resolute
        will effects and offers Him by working against the weight of the flesh,
        and the repugnances in the inferior part of the soul, and in spite of
        sadness, aridity, and interior desolation.
      </p>
      <h3>289.</h3>
      <p>
        What can I say to you on the return of your miseries, save that as the
        enemy returns we must resume our arms and bring back our courage, in
        order to fight more valiantly than ever?
      </p>
      <h3>290.</h3>
      <p>
        Beware of yielding to any kind of distrust, for the heavenly goodness
        does not permit you to fall in order to abandon you, but to humble you,
        and teach you to keep a firmer and closer hold of the hand of his mercy.
      </p>
      <h3>291.</h3>
      <p>
        What happiness to serve God in the desert without manna, without water,
        with no consolation save that of being under His guidance, and suffering
        for Him!
      </p>
      <h3>292.</h3>
      <p>
        When you meet with some contradiction, take your resolutions and place
        them in the wounds of our Lord, and pray Him to preserve them and you
        with them; then wait in these blessed retreats until the tempest has
        past.
      </p>
      <h3>293.</h3>
      <p>
        The throes and pangs of spiritual birth are painful to nature; our souls
        must give birth not exteriorly, but interiorly to the sweetest, the most
        pleasing, the most beautiful child that could be desired. It is the good
        Jesus whom we must form within ourselves. Courage! we must suffer much
        that He may be born in us.
      </p>
      <h3>294.</h3>
      <p>
        You always examine too much to discover whence your sadness comes. We
        must not be so curious as to wish to know the cause of the diversity of
        states in this life. And in what way shall we show our love for Him who
        suffered so much for us, if not by patiently enduring aversions,
        repugnances, and struggles?
      </p>
      <h3>295.</h3>
      <p>
        We must cast our heart among the thorns of difficulties, allow it to be
        transpierced with the lance of contradictions, steeped with gall and
        vinegar; in a word, feed on absinthe and bitterness, since God wills it.
      </p>
      <h3>296.</h3>
      <p>
        I desire that you should continue the exercise of getting rid of self by
        abandoning yourself to our Lord, to the guide of your soul. Say: "I
        earnestly wish it, Lord; tear, wrest from me without hesitation all that
        burdens my heart. I except nothing; wrest me from myself! O self! I
        abandon thee for ever."
      </p>
      <h3>297.</h3>
      <p>
        You must abide like a poor miserable creature before the throne of
        Divine Mercy, and remain there wholly stripped of all action and of all
        affection to creatures, and make yourself indifferent to all things.
      </p>
      <h3>298.</h3>
      <p>
        How beautiful it is to renounce esteem of self, to renounce what we are,
        our own will, all complacency in the creature, and, in short, all of
        self. We must bury this human self in an eternal abandonment, that we
        may never more see or know it as we have seen and known it.
      </p>
      <h3>299.</h3>
      <p>
        The virtues which grow in prosperity are of little value; those which
        are born in the midst of afflictions are strong and firm. In this life
        God usually allows his children and faithful servants only the honour of
        suffering much and carrying their cross after Him.
      </p>
      <h3>300.</h3>
      <p>
        A heart indifferent to all things is like a ball of wax in the hands of
        God, capable of receiving all the impressions of his eternal good
        pleasure. It does not place its love in the things which God wills but
        in the will of God which decrees them.
      </p>
      <h3>301.</h3>
      <p>To belong wholly to God say adieu to all that is not God.</p>
      <h3>302.</h3>
      <p>
        A monastery is an academy of strict correction, where each one should
        allow himself to be treated, planed, and polished so that all the angles
        being effaced he may be joined, united, and fastened to the will of God.
      </p>
      <h3>303.</h3>
      <p>
        It is an evident sign of perfection to wish to be corrected, for the
        principal fruit of humility is to show us the need we have of
        correction.
      </p>
      <h3>304.</h3>
      <p>
        Does God look upon you with love? What a subject to be in doubt about!
        In his goodness He looks down with love upon the most terrible sinner,
        have he never so little true desire to be converted.
      </p>
      <h3>305.</h3>
      <p>
        When shall we become wholly dead to ourselves in the sight of God, and
        live that new life in which we shall no longer wish to do anything of
        ourselves, but leave God to do all that He will through us, and let his
        living will act upon ours, wholly dead in his love?
      </p>
      <h3>306.</h3>
      <p>Jesus our Heart, our Heart of Hearts, lovingly watches over us.</p>
      <h3>307.</h3>
      <p>
        Rest your spirit upon the stone which was represented by the one beneath
        the head of Jacob, for it is the same upon which St. John reposed on the
        day when his Master manifested the excess of his love.
      </p>
      <h3>308.</h3>
      <p>
        Behold St. Peter; fear is a greater evil than the evil which is feared;
        it would have caused him to perish in the waters had not his Master
        saved him. Oh! child of little faith, fear not! You are walking on the
        waters, in the midst of the wind and waves, but it is with Jesus; if
        fear seizes you cry loudly, "Lord, save me or I perish!" He will extend
        his hand to you; clasp it firmly and go on joyously.
      </p>
      <h3>309.</h3>
      <p>
        Yes, abandonment to God in interior and exterior suffering is excellent.
        Oh! how good it is to live but in God, to work but in God, to rejoice
        but in God.
      </p>
      <h3>310.</h3>
      <p>
        When we are in doubt of not having done our duty, or of having offended
        God, we must humble ourselves, beg God to forgive us, and start afresh.
        Pure love of God says to us: "Unfaithful one, humble thyself, rely upon
        the mercy of God, ask pardon, and after renewed promises of fidelity and
        love, continue on in the pursuit of thy perfection."
      </p>
      <h3>311.</h3>
      <p>
        I must tell you that you are now dead to the world. This is a part of
        the holocaust; there remain two other parts, one of which is to remove
        the skin of the victim, divesting your heart of self, cutting off or
        getting rid of all the impressions of nature and of creatures; and the
        other, to burn and reduce your self-love to ashes, and to convert your
        whole soul into flames of heavenly love.
      </p>
      <h3>312.</h3>
      <p>
        You should be particularly careful to lean wholly to the side of
        humility, since you are so much inclined to pride and self-esteem.
      </p>
      <h3>313.</h3>
      <p>
        Let us humble ourselves and speak of our wounds and miseries at the door
        of the temple of divine piety; but remember to show them with joy, and
        be perfectly happy to appear in want and despoiled of all things, in
        order that our Lord may fill you with his grace.
      </p>
      <h3>314.</h3>
      <p>
        Be sweet and affable to all except to those who would take from thee thy
        glory, which is thy misery and thy absolute poverty: "I glory in my
        infirmities," says the Apostle; "it is good for me to die, rather than
        that any man should make my glory void." See, he would rather die than
        lose his infirmities.
      </p>
      <h3>315.</h3>
      <p>
        Yes, you must keep your misery and lowliness, for God looks down upon
        it. Men look at the exterior, God looks at the heart; if He sees the
        lowliness of your heart He will give us great graces. This humility
        preserves chastity; that is why the soul of the spouse is called the
        <em>Lily of the Valley</em>.
      </p>
      <h3>316.</h3>
      <p>
        Keep yourself joyously humble before God, but maintain an equally joyous
        humility before the world. Be very glad that men make no account of you.
        If you have their esteem laugh at it joyously; if they esteem you not,
        console yourself that, as regards you at least, the world judges truly.
      </p>
      <h3>317.</h3>
      <p>
        I am truly like those fathers who never tire speaking with their
        children of means for their advancement. But what shall I say to you to
        this end? Be always very lowly; humble yourself more and more every day.
        This is true greatness.
      </p>
      <h3>318.</h3>
      <p>
        I have gotten the habit of recommending all who address themselves to me
        to lift up their hearts, as the Church tells us in the Holy Sacrifice of
        the Mass. A heart thus generously lifted up is always humble, for it is
        established in truth and not in vanity; it is sweet and peaceful, for it
        makes no account of what could trouble it.
      </p>
      <h3>319.</h3>
      <p>
        When I say that the heart is sweet and peaceful, I do not mean that it
        does not suffer and feel affliction. No, certainly, I do not say that;
        but I say that it meets sufferings, trials, and tribulations with such a
        strong will to bear them for God, that all its bitterness is full of
        peace and tranquillity.
      </p>
      <h3>320.</h3>
      <p>
        It is a great part of our perfection to bear with one another in our
        imperfections. How can we, in fact, practise love for our neighbour, if
        not by this forbearance?
      </p>
      <h3>321.</h3>
      <p>
        Our heart must be kind and gentle towards our neighbour, and full of
        affection for him, particularly when he is wearisome and displeasing to
        us, for then we find nothing in him to make us love him but respect for
        our Saviour.
      </p>
      <h3>322.</h3>
      <p>
        If your heart be in heaven the winds of the earth cannot move it. No
        action of the world can harm him who has renounced the world.
      </p>
      <h3>323.</h3>
      <p>
        Speak of yourself as little as possible; this I tell you earnestly;
        remember it and pay attention to it. If you are imperfect, humble
        your[check] self and do not speak of it.
      </p>
      <h3>324.</h3>
      <p>We must die between the two pillows of humility and confidence.</p>
      <h3>325.</h3>
      <p>
        We must fortify our courage, and never give up because of obstacles, but
        fight valiantly, astonished neither at the number of our enemies nor the
        duration of the struggle.
      </p>
      <h3>326.</h3>
      <p>
        Lord, command my soul all that Thou wilt, and give me strength to obey.
        Thou hast begun in me the work of my perfection, and I can never doubt
        that thy goodness will achieve it, if I faithfully co-operate with Thee.
      </p>
      <h3>327.</h3>
      <p>
        In what do you think the greatness of courage consists? It is in the
        humility of courage, and yours will be greater in proportion to the
        humility in which you possess it, that is, in proportion to your little
        esteem of yourself.
      </p>
      <h3>328.</h3>
      <p>
        Recall to mind the words so admirably impressed upon the hearts of the
        apostles by our Saviour: "Unless you be converted and become as little
        children, you shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven." Verily, if we
        would attain perfection we must be like little children in our courage,
        that is, humble, gentle, docile, and easily turned to any purposes.
      </p>
      <h3>329.</h3>
      <p>If you speak, speak of God; if you are silent, speak to God.</p>
      <h3>330.</h3>
      <p>
        I would rather be a gnat by the will of God than a seraph by my own.
      </p>
      <h3>331.</h3>
      <p>
        Our gentleness with our neighbour must be carried to extreme, even to
        foolishness, and we must never retaliate; believe me, if we lose
        something by this, our Lord will make it up elsewhere.
      </p>
      <h3>332.</h3>
      <p>
        Courage, my very dear daughter: behold, you are at last upon the sacred
        altar to be sacrificed, immolated, consumed before the face of the
        living God. Truly, this day must be counted as one of the days which the
        Lord has made.
      </p>
      <h3>333.</h3>
      <p>
        Ah! how happy are these beloved hearts of my daughters, in having left
        for a few years the false liberty of the world to enjoy eternally the
        enviable slavery which takes away no liberty, save that which would
        prevent us from being truly free.
      </p>
      <h3>334.</h3>
      <p>
        I know the state of your soul very well, and I seem to see it always
        before me with its little emotions of sadness, surprise, and disquiet--
        emotions which continue to trouble it, because it has not yet cast deep
        enough the foundations of love of the cross and abjection.
      </p>
      <h3>335.</h3>
      <p>
        No, my dear daughter, it is not necessary to the practice of virtues to
        be continually mindful of all of them; that would only embarrass your
        thoughts and your affections. Humility and charity are the mother cords
        to which all the others are attached: one is the highest, the other the
        lowest. The safety of a whole edifice depends upon the foundation and
        the roof. These are the mother virtues, which the others follow as
        little chickens do the mother hen.
      </p>
      <h3>336.</h3>
      <p>
        I have just spoken of you with our Lord, but I dare not absolutely ask
        for your deliverance; for if it please Him to flay the victim, it is not
        for me to desire that He should not; but I implore Him to hold you by
        the hand as He has always done.
      </p>
      <h3>337.</h3>
      <p>
        God be praised! Live, Jesus! We must bear our cross; whoever bears it
        best, is through it made the stronger.
      </p>
      <h3>338.</h3>
      <p>
        There never was a saint who did not experience both ecstasy and rapture
        in life and its operations by overcoming himself and his natural
        inclinations.
      </p>
      <h3>339.</h3>
      <p>
        Whoever has a spirit of prayer despatches more business in an hour than
        others in several, and wholly at leisure hastens to his rest, which is
        to treat with God; but God only communicates Himself to the obedient.
      </p>
      <h3>340.</h3>
      <p>
        Never lose your interior peace for anything, whatever it may be, even
        though everything be overturned about you; for what are all the things
        of this life compared to peace of heart?
      </p>
      <h3>341.</h3>
      <p>
        Under all circumstances, be invariable in the resolution to adhere with
        great simplicity and unity to God, by a perfectly trustful love,
        abandoning yourself to the mercy of love and the paternal care which His
        Providence has of you.
      </p>
      <h3>342.</h3>
      <p>
        Remain unalterable in a holy nudity of spirit, never assuming any care,
        desire, affection, or pretension whatever. Our Lord loves you, He wishes
        you to be wholly his; let no arms but his support you, rest upon no
        other breast but his.
      </p>
      <h3>343.</h3>
      <p>
        We must descend to earth to regulate the necessities of this life, but
        in all things our heart should relish only the dew of God's pleasure,
        and refer all to the praise of God.
      </p>
      <h3>344.</h3>
      <p>
        If we love our sweet Saviour let us feed his lambs, since it is a mark
        of faithful love;--but with what must we feed these dear sheep? With
        love itself, for they will either not live at all, or they will live
        upon love.
      </p>
      <h3>345.</h3>
      <p>
        He who would lay up virtues without humility is like one who carries a
        precious dust in his hand exposed to the wind. The great secret of
        maintaining true devotion is to have great humility. Be humble and God
        will be with you. God is pleased to dwell in a heart deepened by
        humility, docile through simplicity, and great through charity. He who
        is truly humble desires to be humbled. Humility produces generosity.
        Remember, my dear daughter, that the keenest humiliations are those
        which are least visible.
      </p>
      <h3>346.</h3>
      <p>
        We must change from one place to another without changing our love or
        the object of our love. Be indifferent to all occupation in the midst of
        different occupations. Be uninfluenced by affairs, and remain equally
        for God in all things.
      </p>

        How happy we shall be if one day we change self into that holy love
        which shall make us one, and entirely free us from all complexity of
        affairs, so that we shall have at heart only the sovereign unity of his
        Holy Trinity.
      </p>
      <h3>348.</h3>
      <p>
        Curiosity, ambition, restlessness, and forgetfulness of the end for
        which we are in this world are the cause of our having more impediments
        than works, more bustle than business, more undertakings than results.
        And these incumbrances, these superfluous occupations with which we
        burden ourselves, are what divert us from God, and not the legitimate
        exercise of our employments.
      </p>
      <h3>349.</h3>
      <p>
        Our perfection must be true and solid. For example, though anger is
        raging within me, though my blood boils, I will not cease to be as
        gracious and gentle as it is possible to be, and all the reasons which
        nature urges for its release I will strangle as she presents them, I
        will not listen to one of them. This is true virtue, true gentleness.
        Ah! God gives you occasion to practise patience.[check] Would you let it
        escape you? Perhaps you may never in life meet with such another
        opportunity.
      </p>
      <h3>350.</h3>
      <p>
        Courage, my poor mind! Let us reject all discourse, research, inquiry;
        let us become more simple, and be rid of this tiresome care of self; let
        us confine ourselves to the simple view of God and our own nothingness.
        Let us steadily lean upon the results of the sovereign will, even when
        we fall, for the dear Jesus will give us the necessary sentiments. O
        mind, one is never wholly master of thee.... Thou wouldst know all in
        spite of us. 0 my God, stop this miserable wanderer!
      </p>
      <h3>351.</h3>
      <p>
        The saints did not abound so much in sensible sentiments, they worked
        according to the lights and truths of faith. Ah! let us be ever wholly
        detached from everything before God, taking no trouble for what comes to
        us. Let all that is not God be as nothing to us. Let us contemplate the
        infinite goodness of God and forget ourselves. Let us immolate all our
        affections to Jesus Christ.

        Condescending to the humour of others, bearing with rudeness and
        tiresome manners on the part of our neighbour, victories over our own
        humours and passions, renouncing our smallest inclinations, efforts
        against our aversions and repugnances, a continual endeavour to maintain
        the peace of our soul, a kind and amiable manner of receiving censures
        upon our condition, our life, our conversation, are all more fruitful to
        our soul than we can imagine, provided love for God be the motive which
        animates us.

        Whenever I enter a place consecrated to our august Queen, I experience a
        thrill of love which tells me that I am with my mother, for I feel that
        I am the child of her who is called the refuge of sinners.
      </p>
      <h3>354.</h3>
      <p>
        Away from me those who love severity, for I will have none of it! It is
        better to be obliged to account to God for too much gentleness than too
        much severity. Is not God all love? God the Father is the father of the
        wretched; God the Son is called a lamb; God the Holy Ghost manifests
        Himself under the form of a dove. If there were anything better than
        benignity Jesus Christ would have told us, and yet He gives us but two
        lessons to learn of Him--meekness and humility.

        The passport of the daughters of Jesus Christ is peace. The joy of the
        daughters of Our Lady is peace. We must always be at peace. Know that
        the virtue of patience is that which most assures us perfection; and if
        we are to be patient with others, we must be equally so with ourselves.
        May Jesus be in the midst of thy heart, and thy heart in the midst of
        Jesus! May Jesus live in thy heart, and thy heart in Jesus! Amen.

        Great saints never are guilty of mortal sin, but only of useless,
        ill-timed, imprudent, and rude actions; slight acts of impatience,
        slight excesses of joy, of mirth, slight failings in vanity, and other
        like faults are useless movements and irregularities into which the just
        fall seven times--that is, very often.

        If I want only pure water, what does it matter whether it be brought me
        in a vase of gold or glass? What is it to me whether the will of God be
        presented to me in tribulation or consolation, since I desire and seek
        only the divine will?
      </p>
      <h3>358.</h3>
      <p>
        A heart indifferent to all things is like a ball of wax in the hands of
        God, to receive all the impressions of his eternal good pleasure, a
        heart with no choice, disposed for all things, placing its affection,
        not in the things which God wills, but in the will of God which decrees
        them.

        Paradise is no more pleasing than the miseries of this world, if the
        divine good pleasure be equally in the miseries as in paradise. Labour
        is paradise, if the divine will be found in it, and paradise labour, if
        the divine will be not in it.
      </p>
      <h3>360.</h3>
      <p>
        The divine good pleasure is the sovereign object of the detached soul;
        wherever it sees it, it runs in the odour of its perfumes, unceasingly
        seeks the places where it most abounds, regardless of all other things.
      </p>
      <h3>361.</h3>
      <p>
        In the monastery of the devout life each one considers himself a novice,
        and a lifetime is devoted to a probation according to the rule of the
        order; it is not the solemnity of the vows but their fulfilment which
        makes novices professed.
      </p>
      <h3>362.</h3>
      <p>
        He who ardently loves God does not turn back his gaze upon himself to
        discover what he is doing, but keeps his heart occupied with God, the
        object of his love. A heavenly chorister takes so much delight in
        pleasing God, that he desires no pleasure from the melody of his voice,
        save as it is pleasing to his Sovereign.
      </p>
      <h3>363.</h3>
      <p>
        There is nothing so sad as to serve a master who knows nothing of our
        devotion, or who, if he knows it, gives no sign of being satisfied with
        it; and it must be a strong love which sustains itself alone,
        unsupported by any pleasure or aspiration. Thus does it happen in the
        exercises of sacred love; like deaf choristers we do not hear our own
        voice, on the contrary, we are oppressed by a thousand fears, and by the
        uproar which the devil makes about our heart, suggesting that we are not
        pleasing to our Master, that our love is useless, yea, even false and
        vain. Oh, my dear Theotime! it is then we must manifest an invincible
        fidelity to our Saviour, serving Him purely for love of his will, not
        only without pleasure, but in the midst of this deluge of sadness,
        terrors, alarms, and temptations.
      </p>
      <h3>364.</h3>
      <p>
        No, Lord, I wish for no event; for I leave Thee to will it for me as
        Thou pleasest; but instead of wishing for events I bless Thee for those
        Thou has ordained. Father, I am thine. I know not what I should wish; it
        is for Thee to will and do for me all that shall seem to Thee good. "My
        Father truly loves me, and I am wholly his."
      </p>
      <h3>365.</h3>
      <p>
        O Jesus! be my sweetness and my honey; sweeten my heart by the sweetness
        of thine.
      </p>
      <h3>366.</h3>
      <p>
        To whom is He not good, this Sovereign Love[check] of hearts? Those who
        taste of his sweetness can never be sated therewith, and those who
        approach His heart cannot contain their own with praising and blessing
        Him for ever. Continue to unite yourself more and more to this dear
        Saviour. Bury your heart in the charity of his, and let us say with all
        our heart: "May I die and Jesus live; this shall be a happy death if it
        take place in this life." May you be blessed with the benediction which
        the Divine Goodness has prepared for hearts which abandon themselves a
        prey to his sacred and holy love.
      </p>
      <h3>367.</h3>
      <p>
        You must bow your head and bear yourself contrary to your habits or
        inclinations. Live humbly before God, amiably with your neighbour, and
        sweetly with yourself.
      </p>
      <h3>368.</h3>
      <p>
        Cast your thoughts earnestly upon the shoulders of the Saviour, and He
        will support and strengthen you. When He calls you to a kind of service
        which is contrary to your taste, your courage should not be less,
        but[check] rather more than if your taste concurred with his pleasure,
        for where there is least of self the work goes best.[check] Do not
        permit your mind to consider itself, its powers, its inclinations. You
        must keep your eyes fixed upon the good pleasure of God, and upon
        Providence.
      </p>
      <h3>369.</h3>
      <p>
        We must not amuse ourselves with discoursing when we should run, nor
        with chatting about difficulties when we should conquer them. Say
        courageously: "I will do much; not I, but the grace of God which is
        within me."
      </p>

        Hold the cross of our Lord upon your breast, and as long as you firmly
        clasp it in your arms, the enemy will be at your feet.
      </p>
      <h3>371.</h3>
      <p>
        Ah! how I would like to see you always transfigured in our Lord! Oh! how
        beautiful is his face, how sweet his eyes in their wonderful gentleness,
        and how good it is to be with Him on the mount of glory! It is there we
        should lodge our affections, and not on this earth, where there is
        nothing but empty beauty and false vanity.
      </p>
      <h3>372.</h3>
      <p>
        May God give you strength to break the ties which prevent you from
        following the heavenly attractions of your heart! Ah! it is sad to see a
        little bee in the treacherous coils of a spider, but if a favourable
        wind of grace break these wretched fetters, these unfortunate meshes,
        why does not this dear bee hasten to disentangle itself and proceed to
        the making[check] of its sweet honey.
      </p>
      <h3>373.</h3>
      <p>
        The sting of honey-bees is much more dangerous than that of other bees,
        and so the machinations of friends against us are exceedingly hard to
        bear; but we must endure them, bear with them, and finally love them as
        dear contradictions. We must absolutely, invariably, and inviolably
        desire only God. But the means of serving Him should be the object of a
        very feeble desire on our part, so that if one means be taken from us we
        shall not be greatly affected thereby. Our desire for everything which
        is not God should be very weak and indifferent.
      </p>
      <h3>374.</h3>
      <p>
        When we are ill in body we must exact of our minds only acts of
        submission and acceptance of labour, and acts uniting our will with the
        good pleasure of God,[check] which acts are formed in the superior part
        of the soul. As to exterior actions, we must perform them as best we
        can, even though it be languidly, heavily, and against our inclinations;
        and to make them acceptable to Divine Love, we must acknowledge, accept,
        and cherish the holy abjection of our state. In this way you will change
        the lead of your languor into gold, and that, too, finer gold than your
        heart could offer in its brightest and happiest moments.
      </p>
      <h3>375.</h3>
      <p>
        It seems to me that I see your[check] heart before me like a dial placed
        in the sun, which never moves, while its needle and balance are
        continually in motion, ever turning towards the beautiful planet; for
        your heart in like manner remains motionless, while your will is
        continually turning by means of its good desires towards God.
      </p>
      <h3>376.</h3>
      <p>
        How is your poor heart? Is it always valiant and vigilant against
        attacks of sadness? In God's name, do not torment it, even though it
        wander a little; reprove it gently, and bring it back to the path. You
        will see that this heart will become a true heart, according to the
        Heart of God.
      </p>
      <h3>377.</h3>
      <p>
        Think of that great dereliction which our Master endured, and see how
        this dear Son, having asked consolation of his good Father, and seeing
        that He willed not to grant it, thought of it no more, ceased to seek
        it, but, as if He had never desired it, valiantly and courageously set
        about the work of our redemption. After you shall have prayed to your
        Heavenly Father for consolation, if it does not please Him to give it
        you, cease to think of it, but renew your courage to work out your
        salvation on the cross, as if you were never to descend therefrom.
      </p>
      <h3>378.</h3>
      <p>
        O my God! how beautiful, how lovely is this cross! We make every effort
        to obtain the wood, and we exalt it on the Mount of Calvary. Alas! happy
        are those who love it and bear it. It will be exalted in heaven, when
        our Lord shall come to judge the living and the dead, to teach us that
        heaven is the mansion of crucified souls.
      </p>
      <h3>379.</h3>
      <p>
        I love independent, vigorous, and sensible souls; for this great
        sensibility confuses and disquiets the heart, and distracts it from the
        prayer of loving attention to God, prevents complete resignation, and
        impedes the perfect destruction of self-love. I am the most affectionate
        person in the world; and it seems to me that I love nothing but God, and
        all souls for God.
      </p>
      <h3>380.</h3>
      <p>
        When a soul aspires to be the spouse of Jesus Christ, it must cast off
        the old man and clothe itself in the new, by giving up sin, and then
        cutting off from its life all the superfluities which could divert it
        from divine love.
      </p>
      <h3>381.</h3>
      <p>
        As the exercise of purity of heart ends only with life, let us not be
        troubled at sight of our imperfections. Our perfection consists in
        combating them, and we cannot combat or vanquish them without feeling
        and knowing them.
      </p>
      <h3>382.</h3>
      <p>
        Our Lord is the mysterious tree of desire of which the holy spouse of
        the canticle speaks. It is to his feet, then, that we must go to breathe
        a sweeter air, howsoever little the heart may be oppressed by the
        atmosphere of the world.
      </p>
      <h3>383.</h3>
      <p>
        We desire to build a great edifice, that is, to erect God's dwelling
        within us; therefore let us consider whether we have sufficient courage
        to ruin ourselves, or to let God raze us to the ground that He may
        rebuild us into a living temple of his Majesty.
      </p>
      <h3>384.</h3>
      <p>
        Our sole pretentions should be to be united to God, as our Lord was
        united to his Father when He died on the cross.
      </p>
      <h3>385.</h3>
      <p>
        Desire nothing, ask nothing, refuse nothing; this practice contains all
        perfection.
      </p>
      <h3>386.</h3>
      <p>
        There is a certain simplicity of heart which contains the perfection of
        all perfections; and it is this simplicity which makes our soul consider
        God alone, and keep its forces wholly collected within itself, in order
        to devote itself with all possible fidelity to the observance of his
        laws, with no wish or desire for anything else.
      </p>
      <h3>387.</h3>
      <p>
        Recall yourself sometimes to the interior solitude of your heart, and
        there, removed from all creatures, treat of the affairs of your
        salvation and your perfection with God, as a friend would speak heart to
        heart with another.
      </p>
      <h3>388.</h3>
      <p>
        We retire into God because we aspire to Him, and we aspire to Him that
        we may retire into Him. Thus the retirement of the heart and the
        aspiration towards God are one the effect of the other.
      </p>
      <h3>389.</h3>
      <p>
        Our will can never die, but it sometimes passes beyond the limits of its
        ordinary life to live wholly in the divine will. This is accomplished
        when it will not and cannot any longer will anything, but abandons
        itself without reserve to the good pleasure of Providence: it no longer
        lives, but the will of God lives in it.
      </p>
      <h3>390.</h3>
      <p>
        Let us be earnestly attentive to blessing God for all that He shall do,
        saying: "The Lord gave and the Lord hath taken away; blessed be the name
        of the Lord." No, Lord, I desire nothing; for I leave Thee to will for
        me wholly as Thou pleasest; instead of wishing for anything, I bless
        Thee for what Thou shalt decree.
      </p>
      <h3>391.</h3>
      <p>
        Hast thou fallen into the net of adversity? Look not at thy misfortunes,
        or the snares into which thou art taken, but turn to God and leave all
        to Him. He will care for thee.
      </p>
      <h3>392.</h3>
      <p>
        We should peacefully abide in our misery and abjection, in the midst of
        our imperfections and weakness until it shall please God to raise us to
        the practice of great virtues.
      </p>
      <h3>393.</h3>
      <p>
        We must live in this world as if our mind were in heaven and our body in
        the tomb.
      </p>
      <h3>394.</h3>
      <p>
        Choose the best virtues and not those which are most esteemed; the most
        excellent, and not the most apparent; the most solid, and not the most
        fanciful.
      </p>
      <h3>395.</h3>
      <p>
        If anger or pride attack me, I must do all in my power to incline my
        heart to humility and meekness, devoting to that end my spiritual
        exercises, the sacraments and the other virtues.
      </p>
      <h3>396.</h3>
      <p>
        Do not limit your patience to certain trials, but extend it universally
        to all that God shall send you, or permit to reach you through any
        source.
      </p>
      <h3>397.</h3>
      <p>
        A truly patient man bears, with the same evenness of temper, ignominious
        trials and those which are honourable. As the sting of bees is more
        painful than that of flies, so the contradictions we experience at the
        hands of good people are more trying than those which come from the
        wicked.
      </p>
      <h3>398.</h3>
      <p>
        Complain as little as possible of injuries, for it rarely happens that
        one complains without sin, since our self-love exaggerates in our eyes
        and hearts the wrongs we have received.
      </p>
      <h3>399.</h3>
      <p>
        You wish absolutely to form Jesus Christ in you, in your heart, in your
        works, by a sincere love of his doctrine and a perfect imitation of his
        life; rest assured it will cost you many pangs; but they will pass away,
        and the presence of Jesus, who shall live in you, will fill your soul
        with an ineffable joy which can never be taken from you.
      </p>
      <h3>400.</h3>
      <p>
        Think frequently of Jesus crucified; consider Him covered with wounds,
        filled with sadness, despoiled of everything, loaded with maledictions.
        Then you will acknowledge that your sufferings can in no way compare
        with his, and that never shall you endure anything in the least degree
        approaching what He suffered for you.
      </p>
      <h3>401.</h3>
      <p>
        God's great desire is that we should be perfect, to unite ourselves with
        Him by the perfect imitation of his sanctity. "Be you therefore perfect,
        as your Heavenly Father is perfect."
